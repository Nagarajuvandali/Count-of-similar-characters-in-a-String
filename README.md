# Count-of-similar-characters-in-a-String
In this program the user input a string and also ask the user to find a particular character from the string entered.So,if the character matches in a String then the character in the String will be replaced by 1 and the if matches for the second time then we will replace with 2 and so on till end of all characters in the string

Suppose the User enters the String as "Testing" and next the user enters the character as "t" then,
The program finds the first occurence of the "t" in the string and change the value to "1esting" and then it finds the second occurence of "t" in the string and then the value will be changed to "1es2ing"

Conclusion:
Input:-  Testing 
And the user wants to find "t" then
Output:- 1es2ing

Input:- Programming
And the user wants to find "m" then
Output:- Progra12ing
